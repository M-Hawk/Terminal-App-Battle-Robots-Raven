# Set the working directory inside the container to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the requirements.txt file from your host into the container's /app folder, needs to do this to install the dependencies before copying the rest of the files
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install necessary system packages:
# - build-base: basic build tools (gcc, make, etc.) needed for compiling Python packages with native extensions
# - bash: install bash shell (some scripts might require it)
# - ncurses: provides terminal handling libraries, needed for terminal-based UI packages
RUN apk add --no-cache build-base bash ncurses

# Use pip to install Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt
# --no-cache-dir prevents caching to reduce image size

# Set an environment variable so Python includes /app in its module search path
# This allows imports like "from src.module import Class" to work correctly

# runs the main.py Python script using Python 3
